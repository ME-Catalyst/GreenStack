## Current Documentation

All current documentation is now **built into the platform** and accessible through the web interface:

- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:5173 → Click "Docs"
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **GitHub Documentation**: See [root README.md](../../README.md)

## Why Archive?

These documents served their purpose during development but have been superseded by:
1. **In-platform documentation** - Interactive, searchable guides built into the web UI
2. **Current project state** - Many issues documented here have been resolved
3. **Active maintenance** - In-platform docs are kept current with code changes

Archived documents are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding project evolution
- Audit trail for major changes
- Learning from past design decisions
